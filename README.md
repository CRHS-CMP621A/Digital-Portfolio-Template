Steps:

1. Use this repository's brainstorm.html file to collect your resources.
    i) Use the in-class brainstorm walls to get ideas.
    ii) You can connect anything from computer class,
   or from other courses or from outside school.
    iii) Organize resources into proper folder structure (imgs, vids, other...)

2. Design your website layout/structure.
    i) Decide what will go on your FIRST page (index.html)
    ii) Use paper or an online tool (https://www.diagrams.net/) to mock up the WIREFRAME for the first page.

3. Build your containers in html.
    i) Use appropriate block elements and add classes as you go.
    ii) Don't worry about layout (grid/flex/float) until after you've finished most of the starter content.
    iii) If you need to, you can put 'filler' content in for paragraphs in order to get things started.

4. Fill in your html containers with content.
    i) Remember that you will have some content that does not go on the index.html first page.
    ii) Start playing with layouts after you have content started.
